\title{Infer band widths from ordered factor levels}
\usage{
infer_band_widths(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \strong{ordered factor} whose levels encode bands in one of the supported
formats (\code{-9}, \code{10-19}, \verb{20-}).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of the same length as \code{levels(x)}, where each
element is the inferred band width. Open-ended bands return \code{Inf}.
}
\description{
Parse range-style factor levels and return the \emph{width} (interval length) for
each band. This is useful when your bands are created by \code{add_band()} and
stored as an ordered factor.
}
\details{
Supported level formats are \strong{strictly}:
\itemize{
\item \code{-9} : open start band, interpreted as \eqn{(-\infty, 9]} → width = \code{Inf}
\item \code{10-19} : closed band, interpreted as \eqn{[10, 19]} → width = \code{19 - 10 + 1 = 10}
\item \verb{20-} : open end band, interpreted as \eqn{[20, \infty)} → width = \code{Inf}
}

Any other format (including spaces like \code{"10 - 19"}, non-integers, extra dashes,
etc.) will raise an error.

\examples{
x <- ordered(c("-9", "10-19", "20-"), c("-9", "10-19", "20-"))
infer_band_widths(x)
#   -9 10-19   20-
#  Inf    10   Inf

}
