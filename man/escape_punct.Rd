\title{Escape punctuation characters in a string}
\usage{
escape_punct(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector whose punctuation characters should be escaped.}
}
\value{
A character vector of the same length as \code{x}, with each punctuation
character replaced by an escaped version (e.g., \code{"."} becomes \code{"\\\\."}).
}
\description{
Escapes all punctuation characters in a character vector by prefixing
them with a backslash (\verb{\\\\}). This is useful when preparing text for use
in regular expressions or other contexts where punctuation has special meaning.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
escape_punct("Hello, world!")   # "Hello\\, world\\!"
escape_punct("a+b=c?")          # "a\\+b\\=c\\?"
escape_punct(c("A.B", "C/D"))   # "A\\.B" "C\\/D"
