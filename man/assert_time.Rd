\title{Validate an "HH:MM" 24-hour time string}
\usage{
assert_time(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character scalar expected to represent a time in \code{"HH:MM"}
24-hour format.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{x} when validation succeeds.
}
\description{
Checks that the supplied value is a non-missing character scalar
representing a valid 24-hour time in \code{"HH:MM"} format. Hours must be
within \verb{00–23} and minutes within \verb{00–59}. The function is intended for
validating user-supplied time specifications used by higher-level
scheduling or switching functions.
}
\details{
The function performs two levels of validation:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Type check} — \code{x} must be a non-missing character vector of length 1.
\item \strong{Format check} — The value must match the regular expression
\verb{^(?:[01]?\\\\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\\\\d$}, ensuring:
\itemize{
\item hours are \verb{0–23} (accepts \code{"7:05"}, \code{"07:05"}, \code{"23:59"}),
\item minutes are \verb{00–59},
\item a literal colon separates hours and minutes.
}
}

If validation fails, an informative error is thrown. On success,
the input is returned invisibly.
}
\examples{
assert_time("09:30")   # OK
assert_time("7:05")    # OK

\dontrun{
assert_time("25:10")   # Error: invalid hour
assert_time("09:77")   # Error: invalid minute
assert_time(c("09:30","10:00")) # Error: must be scalar
}

}
