\item{cols}{Columns to target, passed to \code{\link[=capture_names]{capture_names()}}.
Can be specified as unquoted names (e.g., \code{c(x, y)}),
a character vector (e.g., \code{c("x","y")}), or integer indices (e.g., \code{c(1,2)}).

}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Only \strong{character} columns are targeted by default.
\item Punctuation matched by \code{pattern} is removed \strong{in place}; \code{NA} is preserved.
\item The default pattern keeps asterisks: \code{pattern = "(?!\\\\\\\\*)[[:punct:]]"}.
\item If \code{cols} includes non-character columns, they are rejected with an error.
